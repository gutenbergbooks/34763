<h3 class="h3left"><i>SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR THE "PRODUCERS" OF<br />
THESE PLAYLETS</i></h3>


<p>In every case the tune of the nursery rhyme, the dramatized
version of which is about to be acted, should be played through
twice on the piano before the curtain is raised: the first time
without singing; the second time the audience, of which the
majority presumably will be children, should be asked to join
in and sing it too, led by the performers singing it behind the
scenes. At the close of the piece, when the curtain has fallen
at the place indicated in the text it should (if justified by
applause) be raised again, discovering the performers standing
in a row. These should sing the rhyme through again to the
piano accompaniment, the audience joining in as before, after
which the curtain is finally lowered.</p>

<p>The scenery can in nearly every case be arranged by using
folding screens. In one or two pieces, such as <i>Goosey-Goosey-Gander</i>
and <i>Ride-a-Cock-horse</i>, it would be improved by being
a little more elaborate. But even in these, if there is no artist
in the family who can paint a Banbury Cross or a farmyard in
the background, a large label can be hung up to show in what
kind of surroundings the action is taking place. As to costume,
the period of none of the plays, fortunately, is precisely known,
and the performers therefore can be dressed up as they choose.
Where animals' heads are required, such as the <span class="smcap">Cow</span>, <span class="smcap">Dog</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Cat</span> in the <i>Cat and the Fiddle</i>, the <span class="smcap">Goose</span> and <span class="smcap">Drake</span> in <i>Goosey-Gander</i>,
and the <span class="smcap">Cock</span> in <i>Ride-a-Cock-horse</i>, these will not be
found very difficult to make out of cardboard, not too stiff, bent
to the shape required and roughly painted.</p>

<p>In one or two of the plays there are speaking parts which
can be taken by quite little children, such as the <span class="smcap">Dish</span> and
<span class="smcap">Spoon</span> in the <i>Cat and the Fiddle</i>, the latter especially being
within the grasp of the smallest performer able to speak distinctly
enough for the words to be recognisable. The part of
<span class="smcap">Polly</span> in <i>Polly Put the Kettle On</i> can be played by any
intelligent child of five. In <i>Oranges and Lemons</i>, <i>Humpty
Dumpty</i>, and <i>Ride-a-Cock-horse</i> there are possibilities of a
crowd in which any number of children available can "come
on" and so take a share in the performance.</p>

<p>The writer ventures to suggest that the preface of a book<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
entitled <i>Fairy-Tale Plays</i> (Longman) contains detailed directions
which may be found helpful for rehearsing with children.
The great thing for the "Producers" to remember is not to
cast a gloom over the proceedings by being depressed or losing
their tempers when the performers still don't know their parts
on the day of the performance, when their "business" at that
performance is exactly opposite to that inculcated at rehearsals,
and when they invent on "the night" an entirely new series
of mistakes. It does not matter if they do. The audience, which
will probably largely consist of the relations of the performers,
will be just as pleased whatever happens, and so will every
child-lover who is looking on. So will the actors, whose enjoyment
is assured if they are acting and dressing up. And the
spectator who does not like seeing their enjoyment does not
deserve to have any himself, so we need not take him into
account.</p>

<p>Neither the writer nor the producers of these absurd little
plays, therefore, need have much fear of failure. They are
spared the acute preliminary&mdash;and subsequent&mdash;agonies of
those who produce plays of a larger size and a better quality
than those contained in this little book.</p>

<h4>SCENE</h4>

<p><i>A room in Mrs. MOOCOWS Boarding House. A chair R.C., a settee, or another
chair, up stage R. At back L.C. two ordinary folding screens about 2ft. 6in. apart, a
curtain hung across the space between them. A picture of a full moon painted on a
large piece of cardboard must be propped up behind the opening between the screens,
so that when the curtain is drawn back the moon is seen on the horizon,</i> i.e. <i>its lower
edge on the level of the ground.</i></p>

</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Cow.</span> Dog!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dog.</span> Yes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cow.</span> Do you like the cat?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dog.</span> No, I don't. Do you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cow.</span> Of course not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dog.</span> Why <i>did</i> you have her to lodge with you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cow.</span> I really don't know. I thought it would be nice to
have someone who was fond of music.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dog.</span> <i>I'm</i> fond of it, but not of the cat's music.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cow.</span> No, her music is a disappointment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dog.</span> I don't care about that great lumpy fiddle of hers,
either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cow.</span> And she <i>will</i> accompany herself on it when she mews.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dog.</span> And then, she's so vain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cow.</span> Yes! She told me she could jump better than I could.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dog.</span> Oh, how absurd.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cow.</span> She says I can't climb a tree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dog.</span> And can you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cow.</span> I've never tried it&mdash;I don't want to. She says <i>you</i>
can't climb a tree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dog.</span> Well, what then? I can stand at the bottom of it and
bark. Can she do that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cow.</span> Of course not. And I told her that if I liked I could
jump over the moon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dog</span> [<i>rather incredulous</i>]. Could you, Cow? Could you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cow.</span> If it were near the ground.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dog.</span> But is it ever near the ground?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cow.</span> Certainly, when it is quite low down and looks all big
and red.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dog.</span> Oh yes, to be sure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cow.</span> And then, the cat gives such a lot of trouble. She
must have her dinner on a dish every day, all mixed up with a
spoon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dog.</span> Such a fuss! Why can't she just have a bone on the
drawing-room carpet&mdash;nothing nicer than that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cow.</span> Or some grass in the field&mdash;so simple? The Dish and
the Spoon don't like having to come down from the dresser
so often. They like being quiet. [<i>Mewing heard.</i>] Not much
chance of being quiet with a cat who practises all day.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Cat</span> <i>L., mewing.</i> <i>She is carrying a 'cello or a violin,
preferably the former. She sits down on chair R.C.
and pretends to tune her instrument, mewing the note
and turning the pegs. If a grown-up who can play
the tune on one of these instruments is not available
for the part of the cat, the child who acts it can be
taught, while mewing the tune through after tuning,
to draw the bow across the open D string and A string
on first beat, provided the instrument is not too
precious for such handling.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Cow.</span> May I ask, Cat&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cat.</span> Don't interrupt, please, when I'm practising. I'm
going to mew at a concert to-night.</p>
<p class="rght">[<i>Goes on.</i></p>

<p class="rght">[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Cow</span> <i>and the</i> <span class="smcap">Dog</span> <i>join in, mooing and barking</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cat</span> [<i>at end of tune</i>]. What are you doing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cow.</span> We're joining in the chorus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cat.</span> There isn't a chorus to that song.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dog.</span> There was that time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cat.</span> Well, don't let it happen again. I shan't practise any
more for the present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dog.</span> That's a comfort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cat.</span> I want my dinner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cow</span> [<i>calls off</i>]. Dish! Spoon! Bring the Cat's dinner.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Dish</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Spoon</span> <i>R</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dish</span> and <span class="smcap">Spoon</span>. If you please, we wish to give notice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cow.</span> Notice! Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dish.</span> There is too much to do here. We don't like having
to bring in so many meals for the Cat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spoon.</span> No, we don't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cat.</span> What impertinence!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dog.</span> Well, then, I'll give notice too as a lodger. I don't
like living under the same roof as the Cat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cow.</span> Do you hear. Cat? You are breaking up my establishment.
I must ask you to leave this day week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cat.</span> Certainly not. I've got my rooms by the year, remember.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dog.</span> Oh dear. Bow, wow, wow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cat.</span> May I ask why you don't like me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dog.</span> I don't like your ways. You wag your tail when you're
angry instead of wagging it when you're pleased.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cat.</span> It <i>is</i> a silly doggish plan to wag it when you're pleased.
How can people know what you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cow.</span> And you're so vain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cat.</span> What about you? You said you could jump over the
moon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cow.</span> I said I could if I liked. But I don't like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cat.</span> I'll bet you can't jump over the moon, whether you
like it or not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cow.</span> I never bet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cat.</span> Then we won't bet for money. But I'll bet you you
can't jump over the moon, and if you can, then I'll have lost
my bet, and I'll go away as you ask; but if you can't, then I'll
stay here as long as I please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dog</span> [<i>who has slyly pulled aside the curtain&mdash;aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Cow</span>].
Say yes, the moon's quite low.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cow</span> [<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Cat</span>]. All right, I'll take your bet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dog.</span> And I'll be umpire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cat.</span> Fair play, mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dog.</span> Dogs are always honest, they are not like cats.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cat.</span> And cats are always polite. They are not like dogs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dog.</span> Now listen, Cat. If the Cow jumps so high that we
can see the moon beneath her, that shall be counted jumping
over the moon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cat.</span> All right, then, draw the curtain so that we can see
the moon.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Oh dear, I never thought I should have such a careless
child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Why didn't you think so, mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Because I was so very tidy myself when I was a little
girl&mdash;just like your Cousin Kitty. Oh, why are you not like
her!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> I do think Kitty is so boring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> My dear child! How wrong to say such a thing
of your cousin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> But, mother, you always say I'm to tell the truth.
So as she is boring, I must say so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> It's wrong to be bored by people who are good.
Kitty is so tidy, so careful about everything: so unlike you.
You're so heedless I can't even send you to the village shop
for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Oh, mother do let me go to the shop for you. I'm
sure I could.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> I do want two pennorth of pepper, but I can't
trust you to get it. I'm sure you would lose the pennies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> No, no. I would hold them tightly in my hand. You
see, I haven't a pocket in this frock. That's one reason why
I lose things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> That is true, and I have made you a nice little
pocket to tie on, in hopes it will make you more careful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Oh, mother, what a darling pocket, and what a pretty
binding!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

loosely. Oh, here is your cousin Kitty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Very well, thank you, aunt, and I feel very happy,
too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> So do I.</p>
<p class="rght">[<i>Looking proudly at her pocket.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Ah, but not for the same reason, I fear. I feel happy
because I am so very good. I'm so tidy and careful, and I
never forget anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> How dull that must be!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Oh, my dear Lucy. Don't say that! Ask Kitty
to tell you how she does it, while I go and write my letters.</p>

<p class="rght">[<i>Goes out.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> No, don't tell me anything about it, Kitty. Look
at my new pocket.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Oh, then, you do miss a lot of excitement! When
I'm going out I have to rush about looking for my things,
and it is so thrilling when I see my shoe far back under the
bed, or my handkerchief in the coal-scuttle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Oh, Lucy, how much better it would be if your
shoes were tidily side by side! You shock me. I always
put my things where they ought to be, and then I find them
again at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Well, I wish you wouldn't, then, and put it into my
mother's head. She's always wanting me to do the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> You must try, Lucy. Try as hard as you can, and
perhaps some day you will grow up like me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> I hope I shan't.</p>
<p class="rght">[<i>Makes a face at her.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Oh, how distressing! I never make a face.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Now I'm going out to shop for mother.</p>

<p class="rght">[<i>Jumps round room and goes out.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span> [<i>looking after her</i>]. Oh, poor girl, how I pity her!
What is that I see on the ground over there? [<i>Goes out
and brings in</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy's</span> <i>pocket</i>.] Why, I believe this is Lucy's
pocket! Dear, dear, how careless of her! What a good thing
I was there ready to pick it up. [<i>Feels in bag.</i>] Nothing in
it. Ha! there's something. No, it's only the binding round
it. Dear, dear, she has lost the money too! I must go and find
my aunt and take it to her.</p>

<p class="rght">[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span>, <span class="smcap">Kitty</span> <i>ostentatiously holding bag so that</i>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> What's that you have, Kitty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span> [<i>holding it up</i>]. It's Lucy's pocket.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> What! Lucy's pocket, that I made her this morning?
What are you doing with it, Kitty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> I'm sorry to say, Aunt Jane, that Lucy dropped it,
and as I happened to be looking round me to see if I could be
useful in any way I saw it and picked it up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> And what about the pence that were in it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> They are not there. I'm very sorry, as I know people
ought to be so careful of money. I always am.</p>

<p class="rght">[<i>Loud boo-hooing heard outside.</i> <i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>.</p>

for you, Kitty Fisher found it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Oh, Kitty, did you? Oh, I am so glad. Give it to
me quickly!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span> [<i>holding it back</i>]. Don't you think, Aunt Jane, I had
better have it? I am so careful of my things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy</span> [<i>angry</i>]. No, you shan't. You shan't have my nice
pocket.</p>
<p class="rght">[<i>Goes to her and drags it away. They fight.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> You are not to fight. That is very wrong.</p>

happy again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> No, of course you can't feel happy as I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Mother, do let me try once more; I really will be
good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Are you sure, Lucy? Will you really try?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Yes, yes, I promise. I'll be like a little girl in a book,
who changes all of a sudden, and never does it again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Very well, then, I'll trust you with it once more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> I'm a little surprised at you, aunt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> And you'll never tell me I'm to be as good as Kitty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> No, because you will be just as good without my
telling you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Good-bye then, aunt, I don't care to stay here if I'm
of no use in setting an example to Lucy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> I can do without your example, thank you.</p>

her pocket Kitty Fisher will not find it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Do you think I can trust you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Yes, ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> You see, Sukey hasn't come in yet, and some people
are coming to tea, so you must put the kettle on to boil, and
make the tea when they come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Yes, ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Do you think you can?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Yes, ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Yes, ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Yes, ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> What do you make the tea with, stupid?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> The kettle, ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> And what else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> The teapot, ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> And what inside the teapot?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly</span> [<i>thinks a minute, then triumphantly</i>]. Water, ma'am.</p>

you keep well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Yes, thank you. I have my worries, of course, like
the rest of us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> [<i>grimly</i>]. We all have. It's a weary world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> Oh, Mrs. Crabstick, cheer up, just when we've
come to such a nice tea-party.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> I depend on my tea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. B.</span> Oh, of course; so do I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> We all do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Well, I hope you'll get it as you like it to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> One doesn't get what one's used to out of their own
house, but if you come out to tea one must make the best of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> [<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span>]. And your little maid, Sukey, makes
such good tea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Yes, she does, but to-day she's out. I'm afraid
she must have had a tumble off her bicycle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> Bicycle indeed! In my young days feet were good
enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> [<i>laughing</i>]. Quite true, Mrs. Crabstick. If we had
been meant to go on bicycles we should be born with wheels
instead of legs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. B.</span> Ah, it's a weary world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Oh dear me, Mrs. Crabstick, don't be so gloomy.
I've got another little maid to take Sukey's place this afternoon.
You'll get your tea all the same. The kettle's boiling
now. Polly, is everything ready?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Yes, ma'am.</p>

<p class="rght">[<i>She brings in the teapot, the guests sit round the table</i>,

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Yes, ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> There's no tea in the teapot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> No, ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> But I told you to put in some tea, and I gave you
the tea-caddy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Yes, ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Then what did you do with the tea?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Put it into the kettle, ma'am.</p>

FARMER GILES<br />
THE COUNTESS<br />

</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Gander</span> and the <span class="smcap">Drake</span> have a language of their own which they are supposed
to use when speaking to one another, but the parts are here written in ordinary
language to be understood by the audience. They understand what the human

<h4>SCENE I</h4>

<p><i>A road, paling at back, parallel to front of stage, with gate supposed to be leading
into farmyard.</i> <i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Gander</span> <i>R. Walks rapidly to the centre of the stage, then
suddenly stops as if bewildered, looks on ground in every direction</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gander.</span> Why, it's gone!</p>
<p class="rght">[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Drake</span> <i>L.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drake.</span> Good morning, Gander.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gander.</span> Good morning's all very well, but where is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drake.</span> What? Where? Which?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gander.</span> Really, Drake, you're the stupidest bird. You're
nearly as stupid as my wife, and I never saw such a goose as
she is. Don't you see what I'm looking for? Don't you see
what's gone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drake.</span> Oh, you don't mean&mdash;what! the puddle! Gone!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gander.</span> Of course. Only yesterday morning there was a
nice large hole just in the middle of the road, and a large
puddle in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drake.</span> So there was. So convenient and delightful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gander.</span> Yes, you were always sure of finding a puddle
there, however dry the rest of the road was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drake.</span> But where has it gone to? Who can have taken it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gander.</span> Oh, I know quite well&mdash;it's that bailiff, of course.
And I know why he did it, too. It was just to spite me, as
he knew that was my favourite walk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drake.</span> I've thought for a long time he had a grudge
against you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gander.</span> Yes, ever since the day that I flapped two of his
horrid little children into the pond.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drake.</span> Serve them right. It will teach them to come
rushing about the farmyard as if it belonged to them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gander.</span> And they're so rude, too. Just imagine, the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
day one of them said to me, "Hallo, goosey-poosey"! I
ask you, <i>is</i> that the way to speak to a gander?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drake.</span> Monstrous!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gander.</span> I sometimes feel inclined to go up to the castle
and complain to the Countess.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drake.</span> Well, why don't you? It's not far across the fields.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gander.</span> Oh yes, I know the way to the castle gates, but
when I got inside it I should be wandering upstairs and downstairs
and in my lady's chamber, and not know where I was.
But still, something must be done about that bailiff.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drake.</span> And the way he comes prancing along on his dapple-grey
pony, as if no one could ride a spirited animal but himself!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gander.</span> Look, here he comes!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Bailiff</span> <i>rides in on hobby horse and curvets and

<p><span class="smcap">Bailiff.</span> I came to have a look at the road. I'm glad to see
that the hole's quite gone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gander</span> [<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Drake</span>]. Listen to him, glorying in it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farmer Giles.</span> Oh ay, they had a grand mending of it.
They filled it and rolled it, and they filled it and they rolled it,
and they filled it and they rolled it, and then, they filled it
and they rolled it again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bailiff.</span> And they've made a good job of it, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gander</span> [<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Drake</span>]. Let's show him we don't like it.</p>

drowned my children the other day. It really isn't safe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farmer Giles.</span> Ah, the little uns was teasing of him, I
daresay. It'll do them no harm to be learned how to behave
in the farmyard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> Indeed I am, and of the live stock there. I
should like to direct it all myself, but I don't think the bailiff
would like it. He is rather tiresome sometimes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Melissa.</span> Still, my lady, he is a most honest man, and
his accounts, as your ladyship always says, are a marvel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> Oh yes, in many ways he is excellent, I know,
and yet he is not popular with the poultry&mdash;no doubt of that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Melissa.</span> That is true. He doesn't seem to get on with
the gander.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> Such a pity. I like the gander myself&mdash;he is
always very civil to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Melissa</span> [<i>laughing</i>]. Really, my lady, he seems such a sensible
bird, sometimes you would really think he understood

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span> [<i>coaxingly</i>]. You give me one, mammy darling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> [<i>smiling</i>]. I'm afraid I haven't one to spare. I
spent my pennies on these.</p>

me sell them again and have some pennies!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> What about the jam then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Oh, I'd much rather have the pennies for the poor
box, so that I could ring my bell too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> Well, you may try to sell them if you like.</p>

with a C.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Muffet</span> [<i>decidedly</i>]. No, nursie, I've done my spelling for

<p><span class="smcap">Nurse.</span> It won't be much of a treat if you spill it all on the

you mustn't begin Curds with a K.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Muffet.</span> I'll begin it with a spoon, dear nursie&mdash;that's best.
I'll go and get it from the kitchen.</p>

<p><i>The grounds&mdash;a grassy hillock&mdash;some trees.</i> <i>Enter the</i> <span class="smcap">Spider</span>, <i>prowling mysteriously</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Spider</span> <i>should have eight legs, made of thick wire, bent and covered with black</i>.

round frame), two from his shoulders.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Spider.</span> Ha, none of those horrid two-legged creatures
about, I am glad to say. I should be ashamed to have so few
legs. Now, let me see. Where shall I start my spinning?
[<i>Sits on tuffet and looks round.</i>] That bough, I think, would be
best ... it's just the right kind of day&mdash;not too shiny, nor too
damp. Just the sort of day for a fly not to see a web. [<i>Looks
round.</i>] Perhaps I'd better look round and see if there's a better
place. Dear me, now there's a bluebottle gone swaggering past.
If I'd had the web ready he'd have blundered straight into it.
Fat blue thing! These winged creatures <i>are</i> so stupid sometimes.
Well, I mustn't lose any more time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nurse.</span> Now, Miss Muffet, you had better sit down and eat
your curds and whey or you'll be splashing it down your frock.
Suppose you sit on that tuffet and eat it while I walk the baby
about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Muffet.</span> Is that called a tuffet? What a nice name!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nurse.</span> Yes, it's called a tuffet because that's where people
sit to eat curds and whey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Muffet.</span> Oh, I'll sit there then. [<i>Establishes herself carefully.</i>]
Now I'll pretend I'm on a desert island, Nurse, and you go
away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nurse</span> [<i>smiling</i>]. Very well. I leave you to the savages.
Good-bye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Muffet</span> [<i>calls after her</i>]. Nurse!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nurse.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Muffet.</span> You won't really go away, will you? You'll only

<h4>SCENE</h4>

<p><i>One side of a village street&mdash;a wall about two feet high up stage, parallel to the
audience. This can be represented by anything that a child could stand on for a minute
before jumping down. Behind it R.C. Mrs. Dumpty's house is seen&mdash;a little gate in
the wall at back L.C. leading to house. There should be exits R., L., and C. at back
through gate.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Dumpty</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Pringle</span> <i>standing at gate</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> Well, good morning, Mrs. Dumpty, I must be
running off now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> Very kind of you to have come in, Mrs. Pringle.
I am sorry Humpty was out, I'd like you to have seen him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> Oh, I can do without seeing him every day, thank
you. Is he as fat as ever?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> How you <i>do</i> go on about his being fat, Mrs. Pringle.
You don't want me to starve the child, do you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> No, but there's a lot of difference between starving
and over-feeding. I'm sure my Billy don't get the half of what
you give Humpty, and just look at him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> Look at him, indeed! Humpty only gets the same
as we get, and has done ever since he's been born. I suppose
your Billy gets nothing but bread and milk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> He didn't have pork chops when he was six months
old, if that's what you mean, Mrs. Dumpty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> Well, I was never one to grudge a baby a bit of
anything it cried for, and no one can say Humpty's not a fine
boy now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> He may be a fine boy, but he is a very naughty one.
He makes more noise than all the rest of the boys put together.
[<i>Noise heard outside.</i>] That sounds like him now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> It's just his high spirits, Mrs. Pringle. I like a boy
to have a bit of spirit.</p>
<p class="rght">[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Humpty</span> <i>with a great noise</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humpty.</span> Hallo, mother!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humpty.</span> Yes, I wish I didn't. I don't like Mrs. Pringle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> Oh, Humpty, I'm surprised at you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> [<i>offended</i>]. I think I'd best be going, Mrs. Dumpty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humpty.</span> Look out that you don't miss the procession, Mrs.
Pringle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> What procession?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humpty.</span> Haven't you heard? All the King's horses and all
the King's men are coming along here on their way to the
Coronation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> Well, that's very nice. I'll take you to the end of
the road, and we'll look at them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humpty.</span> But we needn't go to the end of the road&mdash;they
pass right along here. I shall only have to get on the wall and
I shall see beautifully.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> You're not to get on without me holding on to you.
I'm not going to have you falling off and breaking all your
bones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> I don't believe he's got bones to break. He is made
of nothing but fat and naughtiness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humpty</span> [<i>boisterously</i>]. That's right, Mrs. Pringle. Stick up
for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> I'm not sticking up for you, you naughty boy&mdash;I'm
only sorry for your poor mother having such a son. So unlike
my Billy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> Oh, it's only his playful way, Mrs. Pringle. Run
along and wash your face, Humpty, there's a good boy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humpty.</span> I don't want to wash my face.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> Well, I'm sure I don't know what the King will
say if he sees you with a face like that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> It's enough to make him abdicate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humpty.</span> The King's not coming, you silly old things, it's
his horses and men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> You're a rude boy, and you're to go and wash your
face at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humpty.</span> Well, I don't mind, just for once&mdash;it's nearly a
week since I last did, and it's Monday&mdash;that's the day my face
goes to the wash.</p>
<p class="rght">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

Mrs. Pringle? It would be a nice change for you instead of
looking at your Billy all day&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> You're not very civil-spoken, Mrs. Dumpty, but
I <i>do</i> like to see a procession when I can. But I'm hardly fit to
be seen like this. I'd best slip home and put on my new shawl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> Well, if you do that, I'll just pop on my Sunday
bonnet&mdash;it won't take a minute.</p>

turn back.</i>] First file, take hold of the boy's arms! Second
file, catch hold of his legs! Now&mdash;all together, on to the wall&mdash;lift!
[<i>They try to pick him up.</i>] I'm sorry, ma'am. We can't
move him&mdash;he's rather stout, you see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> What did I say! If only it was my Billy now.</p>

<p class="rght">[<i>More music heard.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">King's Man.</span> Here's another regiment coming&mdash;perhaps
they can do it.</p>
<p class="rght">[<i>Enter more soldiers.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">King's Man.</span> If you please, Colonel&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colonel.</span> Halt! What is it, my man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King's Man.</span> There's a young feller there fallen off the
wall&mdash;we can't get him up again, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colonel.</span> What! All you King's horses and all you King's
men can't do a simple thing like that! Preposterous!
Ridiculous! [<i>He twirls his moustache and is very warlike.</i>]
Sergeant-Major!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sergeant-Major.</span> Yes, Colonel!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colonel.</span> Fall out the regiment, and replace that boy on the
wall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sergeant-Major.</span> Right turn! Dismiss! Now then, all
together.</p>

<p class="rght">[<i>Both regiments dash at</i> <span class="smcap">Humpty</span> <i>and try to pick him up</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colonel.</span> H'm&mdash;it's not so easy as I thought. A charge of
cavalry might do it. [<span class="smcap">Humpty</span> <i>starts</i>.] Or, upon my word, an
explosion of dynamite would be better. Sergeant-Major!</p>

<p class="rght">[<span class="smcap">Humpty</span> <i>trembles</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sergeant-Major.</span> Yes, Colonel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colonel.</span> Blow this boy off the ground with dynamite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> [<i>hurriedly</i>]. Oh, thank you so much&mdash;I won't
trouble you to do that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colonel.</span> No trouble at all, madam, I assure you. It won't
take a moment. Sergeant-Major!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> Oh, how exciting!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> Be quiet, Mrs. Pringle. <i>Pray</i> don't trouble,
Colonel&mdash;I think he is very comfortable where he is, thank you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colonel.</span> Just as you wish, madam&mdash;but if we can't do
anything for you I think we had better be moving on. Sergeant-Major!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sergeant-Major.</span> Yes, Colonel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colonel.</span> Fall in the regiment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humpty.</span> Phew! I felt rather anxious then&mdash;I thought I
should have to get up&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> Get up! But can you get up, my poppet?</p>

<p class="rght">[<span class="smcap">Humpty</span> <i>sits up</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humpty.</span> Of course I can, if I like&mdash;only it was such fun
having them all crowding round and pulling at me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> Well, I never! It would have served you quite
right if they had blown you up as they said.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> How hard you are on the poor child, Mrs. Pringle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> My Billy would never have done such a thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humpty.</span> Of course he wouldn't&mdash;he's much too stupid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> Stupid! Not he&mdash;he's got too much sense to go
falling off a wall just when a procession was coming. I shall go
home and tell him what you did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humpty.</span> And mind you tell him that all the King's horses
and all the King's men couldn't pick Humpty Dumpty up
again&mdash;till he chose!</p>
